# ‚öóÔ∏è Markdown table via ABAP CDS

Just a small, non-serious free time project along the lines of: ‚ÄúIs that actually possible?‚Äù The answer is: "Yes it is!". You can use ABAP CDS and ABAP SQL statment SELECT to get data from the database directly as a Markdown table. I can't think of a business case for this scenario, but it's nice that it's possible üòÇ

### Design

You find details about Markdown [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). This is how Wikipedia describes it: _"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor."_ It's easy to learn and it plays an important role in a lot of platforms like GitHub. One of it features is that you can easy create a nice formatted table output with it.

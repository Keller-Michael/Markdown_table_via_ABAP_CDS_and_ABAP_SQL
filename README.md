# ⚗️ Markdown table via ABAP CDS

Just a small, non-serious leisure project along the lines of: “Is that actually possible?” The answer is: "Yes it is possible". You can use ABAP CDS and ABAP to export data from the database directly as a Markdown table. I can't think of a business case for this scenario, but it's nice that it's possible.
